	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p style="line-height:2">I have been teaching in the M-DCPS system for nineteen years with the last sixteen years at Miami Lakes Educational Center. During this time, I have helped write curriculum to support the facilitation of the state and local standards. I have attended as well as presented numerous workshops to enhance and implement the use of technology in the classroom. Some of these workshops are AP Physics, AP Calculus, AP Statistics, Algebra 2: A Technological Approach, AP Physics with CBLs and Graphing Calculators, Navigating through Algebra, Algebra 1 with technology. Gizmos and Edgenuity are also used frequently in my class. I am certified in Mathematics, Physics, and in Exceptional Education and hold a Masters Degree in Physics.

Even though Theoretical Physics was my original focus, teaching Mathematics ans Science is my passion. I have found teaching to be a very rewarding and invigorating experience that needs to be kept fresh by seeking out innovative approaches that can be used to facilitate instruction. Technology is an integral part of my instruction. My students use the graphing calculator daily and internet projects are used to motivate students, clarify and apply concepts as well as develop critical thinking skills. Additionally, their home-learning assignments are completed on line.
